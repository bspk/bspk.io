          <b>Gridlock: Boston</b> is a competitve board game for 2-4 players about driving around the city where none of the roads make sense and everything is always changing on you. In this game, you'll build out a road network through the city and drive around visiting famous landmarks and areas. But be careful, these roads will change around you as other players are building out their own routes. And don't forget, everyone can use the same roads, so keep an eye on what's happening all over town.
